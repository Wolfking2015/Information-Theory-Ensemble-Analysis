# Information-Theory-Ensemble-Analysis
MATLAB code demonstrating basic analyses of ensembles of information sources

This repository contains MATLAB code that can be used to demonstrate testing whether an ensemble of information sources is significantly different from null and whether two ensembles are significantly different from each other. The figures and methods are described in N. M. Timme, D. Linsenbardt, and C. C. Lapish, A method to present and analyze ensembles of information sources, Entropy, submitted.
